                    <h2 id="consulting">Consulting / Managing / Architect / Advocate</h2>

                    <p>My previous role was as an IBM Consultant and Solution Architect (Data, AI, eDiscovery, Governance)
                        working on various projects for large financial and sporting organisations.</p>

                    <p>I'm used to leading delivery and leading technical direction. I will also get my hands dirty whenever I need to
                        (always hoping to). I'm experienced, use common sense, like to plan, like to communicate, keep things simple and
                        just 'get it done, and get it done right'. I feel customers like my approach to working, I always get good
                        feedback.</p>
                    
                    <p>I have experience of managing support and engineering staff both onsite and offshore. Recently this was as a Python
                        engineering project, prior to that supporting and advocating for a large big data project on the IBM Cloud (hadoop) and
                        also Java engineers for an MDM project including travel to India.</p>
                    
                    <p>As well as the technical skills required to deliver, I am also used to 'how Enterprises work'. Think standard
                        platforms and methods, processes, permissions, design documents, integrations with data, monitoring, logging,
                        automation, security, Virtual Machines, cloud integration, SSO, email, linux security.</p>
                    
                    <p>As part of my IBM labs role I was also an Advocate for IBM software products and engineering on them. I
                        frequently visited customers to talk about this and spoke at a lot of conferences in many different countries, had articles published, book mentions. I
                        also helped run open source projects on behalf of IBM as part of my role.</p>
                    
                    <h2 id="data">Data Engineering</h2>
                    <p>Over time my software engineering and general IT technical skills have been morping into the Data Engineering category.</p>
                    <p>My experience and abilities being that I can write Python and Java, understand and have engineered ETL solutions, understand SQL, have a decent level of linux skills including shell scripts, done a little automation (Ansible, Chef over the years), understand most databases, have high level experience on Hadoop platforms, can install Cloudera locally and on cloud, have an interest in Spark and have general understanding on thing's like data warehouses, data lakes (on prem and cloud). Worked with Docker and REST api's. I also have experience of working 'in the cloud' (IBM) and currently building up working expertise in AWS and Azure.</p>
                    
                    <h2 id="software">Software Engineering</h2>
                    <p>My true love, this isn't work. I've been writing code since I was 10 in some shape or form. I've been a professional software engineer, self taught, for 27 years in lots of languages and on lots of platforms. I can (and love to) learn new ones.</p>
                    <p>These day's I am more of a consultant where I do lots of different things and specialise for a few months at a time then switch to something completely different. I guess that's my skill being able to do that.</p>
                    <p>I do however have the experience to know how to switch, how to get red hot again at that dicipline and therefore how to research and do it right. I especially get very good at different discipline's again very quickly by just doing real work.</p>

                    <h3>Pipelines</h3>
                    <p>I'm used to working with Git and previously Clearcase. I also have experience of working with Jenkins for CI/CD.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Python</h3>
                    <p>The most recent of my experience. I spent most of 2019 designing and coding a Python 3 framework on RHEL Linux platform to perform data integration and automation functions across systems at a large Bank. I designed the Git processes and with others setup the pipeline through production using Jenkins. I like Python its pretty easy, it gets the job done quickly, there are many useful libraries to help you make short work of requirements and you can pull in software engineers from other languages and with leadership will pick it up quickly.</p>

                    <h3>Java</h3>
                    <p>I was a software engineer (Advisory, the step between engineer and senior/lead) within IBM labs for 11 years. For most of those years I wrote Java, as well as other langauges. I love java and it really tests your thought processes and in advance design of objects, framework, TDD. It is however a difficult language to always rememember the technical explanation for stuff (unless maybe that is all you do). If I haven't written Java for awhile I always need a terminology refresher!</p>
                    <P>I have written Java for IBM software products, Servlets, Cloud based administration consoles, WebSphere based extensions for an MDM product, designed and built a gatekeeper for code updates into the cloud (allowing updates for bug fixes or releases to be turned on/off at will). I've not written Java full time for a couple of years now, aside from pet projects, so I am rusty, but eager to get back on the wagon.</P>

                    <h3>Javascript</h3>
                    <p>I was the king at JavaScript. Before there were frameworks (ie Angular, Dojo, JQuery etc) I was building frameworks. I've used Dojo, and JQuery (a little) but none of the others but I can learn, I know the fundamentals. I've dabbled in React, node.js, I've built cool client's for customers using Electron to perform actions against applications that provide REST API's.</p>

                    <h3>Web</h3>
                    <p>Most of my software engineering has been around web servers. Whether that be Apache http or tomcat, IBM Lotus HCL (Take your pick) Notes and Domino. Web applications are my thing and I undestand how to put together/engineer solutions for frontend and backend, deal with authentication, security, accessibility, bidi, integration with database's (most). I'm no visual designer but i'm still an ace at html and css. I can steal your standard and apply it to an application.</p>

                    <h3>Shell</h3>
                    <p>The last few years have seen me work a lot with cloud and linux, I therefore have extended my coding skills to include shell scripting for basic tasks and automation.</p>
            
                    <h3>Notes and Domino (Lotus IBM HCL)</h3>
                    <p>The bulk of my early career was based on this product. Writing client or web applications. Engineer on the product itself (IBM Labs Littleton and Westford). Doing Advocacy, speaking at conferences, articles etc. I was one the first engineering on XPages (JSF), I wrote code that is used by probably hundred of thousands of people in their email clients, calendar, bookmarks, websites, social websites. I wrote blog software that was acquisitioned by IBM and included in their products. Lotusscript, Java, Web expert. Won a global IBM award years before working for them for an eCommerce site (one of the first insurance quotation sites to hit the internet - that's how old I feel).</p>
                
                    <h3>Salesforce</h3>
                    <p>Salesforce is an area of interest to me as it reuses a lot of knowledge from my "collaborative" computing experience with Notes and Domino. Certainly the low code side is a lift, improve, put in a browser from the heady days of citizen development with Notes and Domino.</p>
                    <p>It brings together the best of all worlds of business process improvement and standardisation, low code but equally pro code when needed, in the cloud and most importantly everything your business will need in one place.</p>
                    <p>You can view my Salesforce qualification progress here on <a href="https://trailblazer.me/id?uid=scastledine&cmty=trailhead">Trailhead.</a></p> 
                    
                    <h2 id="cloud">Cloud</h2>
                    <p>I spent many years working for IBM SmartCloud. This involved writing software for and supporting cloud based software (email and email admin). I had to understand the architecture and infrastructure of the cloud appliances as a new way of hosting email for customers with 99.999% availability and what that entails.</p>
                    
                    <p>I also spent time managing the support of and advocating for a huge startup that operated in the IBM cloud using Hadoop and DB2.</p>

                    <p>More recently I have been working with and learning AWS and Azure and understand compute instance's, volume's, snapshots, S3, networking/ip's, cloud native application development and deploying environments and software in those clouds (including Hadoop based environments).</p>
                    
                    <p> I am currently studying for AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner.</p>
                    
                    <h2 id="databases">Databases</h2>
                    <p>As part of software engineering projects, integration requirements, consultancy etc I have done a lot of work with Databases and SQL.</p>
                    <p>I'm no master DBA but have worked on creating data models, schemas, databases, tables, views, reports on DB2, Oracle, SQL Server, Postgresql, SQLite, HBase and nosql with IBM Domino (and even in the old days Access, Excel, dBase etc). I can write SQL as required and understand how to use within code or applying direct for maintainance purposes. Deeper, more complex SQL queries you will ctach me on Google learning and finding out the best query to use for that requirment.</p>
                    
                    <h2 id="ediscovery">eDiscovery</h2>
                    <p>Part of my Consultancy role at IBM was around a product <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/storediq-suite">StoredIQ</a> (eDiscovery). I installed and configured this product (linux containerised appliance) at various organisations and then designed data capture and analysis (regex mainly) using the product in order to assess the data landscape for GDPR purposes, data retention, mergers and aquisitions data discovery.</p>
                    <p>In addition to StoredIQ I also worked extensively with a product <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/storediq-for-legal">StoredIQ For Legal</a> (they do connect but otherwise are completely different). I can install, configure, develop on and integrate this product in the enterprise. I can therefore write BPMN as a workflow developer using BPMN and know the consult and data model required to use this product as a Legal Hold management system.</p>
                
                    <h2 id="governance">Data Governance</h2>
                    <p>As well as GDPR projects using StoredIQ, I have also worked on Master Data Management (MDM) projects as part of a data governance strategy. I can install and configure IBM Websphere and Information Server together with MDM components. I can also consult on the data strategy and write extensions to the main product in Java. As an extension to this I can also work with IBM MQ and IBM BPM and setup the DB2 or Oracle databases.</p>
                
                    <h2 id="other">Other stuff</h2>
                    <p>As part of enterprise projects I have worked on I am experienced in Linux, SSO, email, Databases - Oracle, DB2, SQlite, MySQL, SQL Server, NoSQL, PostGreSQL (i'm no DBA but I know what I need to get by), networking both at a TCP level and the actual cabling, server hardware building, Microsoft Exchange</p>

                </div>
            
                <div class="sectionContent">
                    <p>All of 2019 and some of 2020 I spent on a single project at a bank mostly in London but some time in Zurich.
                        This
                        project was for introducing a new legal hold management system into a bank, performing data analysis,
                        migrating content from an old system and
                        integrating HR, Security, other legal hold management systems. The product being installed being <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/storediq-for-legal">IBM
                        StoredIQ for
                        Legal</a>. My role on this project was as Technical Lead and Integration Architect and eventually Software
                        Engineer for the ETL layer of the solution.</p>
            
                    <p>The project was interesting as it was pretty greenfield in that we started from nothing and had to find out
                        for ourselves the processes, systems in place, and how the bank 'did things'. It took awhile to figure this
                        out and get the design documents published and approved.</p>
            
                    <p>As well as installing and configuring the main product (simple really - Linux based containerised appliance),
                        and integrating it with the usual email gateways, SSO (Siteminder), and then building the workflows using
                        BPMN (that is a time consuming task), we also had to design and build from scratch an integration server
                        based on RHEL7.5 with Python 3.</p>
            
                    <p>This Python framework then handled all data movement (and full ETL processing), mainly using csv data
                        transfer or MS SQL database views and transforming (using an embedded SQLite database for caching/indexing) and then moving the data to REST services on the target
                        system (some of this was some 500,000 HR records, delta'ed by this code each night). It also handled the
                        automated server configuration, account security, migration, logging, backup and monitoring required by the
                        bank. Tranformation's were controlled by object oriented Pyhton code and mapping files to keep it seperate from business and load logic.</p>
                    <p>The framework code itself was kept in Git and then we used Jenkins to package the code and distribute to
                        target servers when builds were ready.</p>
                    <p>All in all this was a high pressure project and the first stage was delivered in 9 months from scratch with
                        the all the above working with the minimal of staffing.</p>
