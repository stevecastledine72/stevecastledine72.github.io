                    <h2>Consulting / Managing / Architect / Advocate</h2>
                    
                    <p>I have spent the last 3+ years as an IBM Consultant and Solution Architect (Data, AI, eDiscovery, Governance)
                        working on various projects for large financial and sporting organisations. Prior to working in IBM labs (was at IBM for 14 years) I also
                        was a self employed contractor so every project I was essentially consulting.</p>
                    
                    <p>I'm used to leading delivery and leading technical direction. I will also get my hands dirty whenever I need to
                        (always hoping to). I'm experienced, use common sense, like to plan, like to communicate, keep things simple and
                        just 'get it done, and get it done right'. I feel customers like my approach to working, I always get good
                        feedback.</p>
                    
                    <p>I have experience of managing support and engineering staff both onsite and offshore. Recently this was as a Python
                        engineering project, prior to that supporting and advocating for a large big data project on the IBM Cloud (hadoop) and
                        also Java engineers for an MDM project including travel to India.</p>
                    
                    <p>As well as the technical skills required to deliver, I am also used to 'how Enterprises work'. Think standard
                        platforms and methods, processes, permissions, design documents, integrations with data, monitoring, logging,
                        automation, security, Virtual Machines, cloud integration, SSO, email, linux security.</p>
                    
                    <p>As part of my IBM labs role I was also an Advocate for IBM software products and engineering on them. I
                        frequently visited customers to talk about this and spoke at a lot of conferences in many different countries, had articles published, book mentions. I
                        also helped run open source projects on behalf of IBM as part of my role.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Data Engineering</h2>
                    <p>Over time my software engineering and general IT techincal skills have been morping into what is starting to be known as Data Engineering.</p>
                    <p>My experience and abilities being that I can write Python and Java, understand and have engineered ETL solutions, understand SQL, have a decent level of linux skills including shell scripts, done a little automation (Ansible, Chef over the years), understand most databases, have high level experience on Hadoop platforms, can install Cloudera locally and on cloud, have an interest in Spark and have general understanding on thing's like data warehouses, data lakes (on prem and cloud). Worked with Docker and REST api's, worked 'in the cloud' (IBM, AWS and Azure).</p>
                    
                    <h2>Software Engineering</h2>
                    <p>My true love, this isn't work. I've been writing code since I was 10 in some shape or form. I've been a professional software engineer, self taught, for 24 years in lots of languages and on lots of platforms. I can (and love to) learn new ones. I probably will fail your tests though. I do lots of different things, I will write Java for a year, whilst consulting in something else, I will do another langauge, I will do data engineering, then Python. I don't possess the memory recall to pass on the spot tests. I do however just know how to do it and do it right. 
                        I know how to google and remind myself on the job at hand. I get good at that discipline again very quickly doing real work.</p>

                    <h3>Pipelines</h3>
                    <p>I'm used to working with Git and previously Clearcase. I also have experience of working with Jenkins for CI/CD.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Python</h3>
                    <p>The most recent of my experience. I spent most of 2019 designing and coding a Python 3 framework on RHEL Linux platform to perform data integration and automation functions across systems at a large Bank. I designed the Git processes and with others setup the pipeline through production using Jenkins. I like Python its pretty easy, it gets the job done quickly, there are many useful libraries to help you make short work of requirements and you can pull in software engineers from other languages and with leadership will pick it up quickly.</p>

                    <h3>Java</h3>
                    <p>I was a software engineer (Advisory, the step between engineer and senior/lead) within IBM labs for 11 years. For most of those years I wrote Java, as well as other langauges. I love java and it really tests your thought processes and in advance design of objects, framework, TDD. It is however a difficult language to always rememember the technical explanation for stuff (unless maybe that is all you do). I remember once getting put off applying for Java jobs after a phone interview which asked highly detailed questions on a specific area of Java programming and I failed badly (and this was when I was writing Java that day).</p>
                    <P>I have written Java for IBM software products, Servlets, Cloud based administration consoles, WebSphere based extensions for an MDM product, designed and built a gatekeeper for code updates into the cloud (allowing updates for bug fixes or releases to be turned on/off at will). I've not written Java full time for a couple of years now, aside from pet projects.</P>

                    <h3>Javascript</h3>
                    <p>I was the king at JavaScript. Before there were frameworks (ie Angular, Dojo, JQuery etc) I was building frameworks. I've used Dojo, and JQuery (a little) but none of the others but I can learn, I know the fundamentals. I've dabbled in React, node.js, I've built cool client's for customers using Electron to perform actions against applications that provide REST API's.</p>

                    <h3>Web</h3>
                    <p>Most of my software engineering has been around web servers. Whether that be Apache http or tomcat, IBM Lotus HCL (Take your pick) Notes and Domino. Web applications are my thing and I undestand how to put together/engineer solutions for frontend and backend, deal with authentication, security, accessibility, bidi, integration with database's (most). I'm no visual designer but i'm still an ace at html and css. I can steal your standard and apply it to an application.</p>

                    <h3>Shell</h3>
                    <p>The last few years have seen me work a lot with cloud and linux, I therefore have extended my coding skills to include shell scripting for basic tasks and automation.</p>
            
                    <h3>Notes and Domino (Lotus IBM HCL)</h3>
                    <p>The bulk of my early career was based on this product. Writing client or web applications. Engineer on the product itself (IBM Labs Littleton and Westford). Doing Advocacy, speaking at conferences, articles etc. I was one the first engineering on XPages (JSF), I wrote code that is used by probably hundred of thousands of people in their email clients, calendar, bookmarks, websites, social websites. I wrote blog software that was acquisitioned by IBM and included in their products. Lotusscript, Java, Web expert. Won a global IBM award years before working for them for an eCommerce site (one of the first insurance quotation sites to hit the internet - that's how old I feel).</p>
                
                    <h2>Cloud</h2>
                    <p>I spent many years working for IBM SmartCloud. This involved writing software for and supporting cloud based software (email and email admin). I had to understand the architecture and infrastructure of the cloud appliances as a new way of hosting email for customers with 99.999% availability and what that entails.</p>
                    
                    <p>I also spent time managing the support of and advocating for a huge startup that operated in the IBM cloud using Hadoop and DB2.</p>

                    <p>More recently I have been learning AWS and Azure and understand compute instance's, snapshots, networking/ip's and deploying environments and software in those clouds. I also know other areas such as S3, automation, scaling but that knowledge is still being developed.</p>
                    
                    <h2>eDiscovery</h2>
                    <p>Part of my Consultancy role at IBM was around a product StoredIQ (eDiscovery). I installed and configured this product (linux containerised appliance) at various organisations and then designed data capture and analysis (regex mainly) using the product in order to assess the data landscape for GDPR purposes, data retention, mergers and aquisitions data discovery.</p>
                    <p>In addition to StoredIQ I also worked extensively with a product StoredIQ For Legal (they do connect but otherwise are completely different). I can install, configure and integrate this product in the enterprise (probably one of the most knowlegeable in the world). I also can wrote workflow using BPMN and know the consult required to use this product as a Legal Hold management system.</p>
                
                    <h2>Data Governance</h2>
                    <p>As well as GDPR projects using StoredIQ, I have also worked on Master Data Management (MDM) projects as part of a data governance strategy. I can install and configure IBM Websphere and Information Server together with MDM components. I can also consult on the data strategy and write extensions to the main product in Java. As an extension to this I can also work with IBM MQ and IBM BPM and setup the DB2 or Oracle databases.</p>
                
                    <h2>Other stuff</h2>
                    <p>As part of enterprise projects I have worked on Linux, SSO, email, Databases - Oracle, DB2, sqlite, MySQL, SQL Server (i'm no DBA but I know what I need to get by), networking both at a TCP level and the actual cabling, server hardware building, Microsoft Exchange</p>
