                    <h2>Software Engineering</h2>
                    <p>My true love, this isn't work. I've been writing code since I was 7 in some shape or form. I've been a professional software engineer, self taught, for 24 years in lot's of languages and lots of platforms. I can (and love to) learn new ones. I probably will fail your tests though. I do lots of different things, I will write Java for a year, whilst consulting in something else, I will do another langauge, I will do data engineering, then Python. I don't possess the memory recall to pass on the spot tests. I do however just know how to do it and do it right. I know how to google and remind myself on the job at hand. I get good at that discipline again very quickly doing real work.</p>

                    <h3>Python</h3>
                    <p>The most recent of my experience. I spent most of 2019 designing and coding a Python 3 framework on RHEL Linux platform to perform data integration and automation functions across systems at a large Bank. I designed the Git processes and with others setup the pipeline through production using Jenkins. I like Python its pretty easy, it gets the job done quickly, there are many useful libraries to help you make short work of requirements and you can pull in software engineers from other languages and with leadership will pick it up quickly.</p>

                    <h3>Java</h3>

                    <h3>Javascript</h3>

                    <h3>Web</h3>
